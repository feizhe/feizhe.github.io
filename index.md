### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Statistics Department](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) at [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. in [Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), and B.S. in Statistics and Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).



### Research Interests

My research is at the intersection of statistical inference and deep learning. Current research interests include high dimensional inference, deep learning with image data, causal mediation analysis, knockoff inference, natural language processing, among others. My research is widely applied in epigenetics, medical imaging, electronic health records, and other public health areas.
